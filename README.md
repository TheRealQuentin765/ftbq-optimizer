# ftbq-optimizer
A tool to make your FTBQ Quest Chapters organized within seconds!

### NOTICE:
***The proccess is lossy!***
Many features of your quests will not be saved!

This tool is meant to let you make a rough sketch of your quests, that you can add more details to later.

### How to use:
1. If minecraft is on, make sure that you are not in game, and leave to the main menu if you must.
2. Choose Import in the program then select a file in `instance/config/ftbquests/quests/chapters` where instance is the name of you minecraft instance
3. Adjust the settings you your liking and drag some of the 'quests' or add some noise to get it to a situation that you like.
4. Stop the simulation, and tweak 'quests' with the differnt mouse control modes.
5. Choose how you want the quests to be exported (as tasks, rewards, or icons of the quests, or a combination).
6. Ensure that you are not in game, and are in the menu or minecraft is closed.
7. Press export and choose a file name, most likely the same one that you imported from. Then choose a size that you want, I recomend to use some where between half and three time the recomended size.
8. Save the file into `instance/config/ftbquests/quests/chapters` and ***do not change the name of the file***. If you want to change the filename, then re-export and use the filename prompt.
